This is a public repo of Doug Braun's UZI (Unix: Z80 Implementation) source
code. The author's site no longer serves the archive and it took some
digging to find, so it's uploaded here for conservation purposes.

Although no LICENSE file is attached, Braun has posted elsewhere that this
code is public domain. If you are Doug Braun and wish me to remove this
code, I will naturally comply (albeit with regret).
